# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Olamilekan Ogunbade (LekinsTechy)ðŸ˜„, a front-end developer based in Nigeria. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

I'm passionate about Web technologies, gaming, and programming, and I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies. Currently, I'm a student at AltschoolAfrica where I'm studying interesting things about the core web technologies HTML, CSS, Javascript, React Native, and so on.


I'm excited to delve deeper into  responsive Website development, as well as Web games. I'm particularly interested in Game Development, and I'm eager to expand my knowledge in this area.
